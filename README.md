# libw2m
a wav2midi load example of Pyin with Cpp/C#/CLI and build in Dev-Cpp(just for a shell test). Any code uses of "libpyin" please goto https://github.com/Sleepwalking/libpyin

this project is only a modules test to try to replace the wav anasisyer of Imitate(Praat and VShifter).It seems is better.
to release gcc into windows/C#.so just a export shell with some demos.

for private test,and includes GPL-3.0(same as libpyin)
